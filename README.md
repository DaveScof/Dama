# Dama

In this Project, we'll build a web application for a Dama game.

Epics:

1. Users can create an account and register
2. Users can play against each other online.
3. Users can play against a single player agent on the server.
4. Single Player agents use deep neural networks to learn the game from online users.
5. Users can access the website using an Android App
